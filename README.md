🧠 AI Diabetes Predictor
An AI-powered web app to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on patient input data, using a trained Random Forest Classifier and SHAP Explainability for feature contribution analysis.

Built with Streamlit, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SHAP.

📋 Features
🏥 Diabetes Prediction based on standard medical features.

🧠 AI Explainability using SHAP values to visualize feature impact.

📊 Model Performance Metrics (Accuracy, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix).

🎨 Modern Dark-Themed UI with custom CSS.

⚡ Fast Inference with model and SHAP explainer caching.

🛠️ Installation & Setup

1. Clone the Repository
   git clone https://github.com/Sasquatch3663/Diabetes--Predictor.git
   cd Diabetes--Predictor

2. Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate      # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install Dependencies
   Create a requirements.txt file with:
   streamlit
   pandas
   scikit-learn
   matplotlib
   seaborn
   shap

3. Then install:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the App
   streamlit run diabetes_predictor_app.py


🧠 Technologies Used
Streamlit — UI/UX Framework
